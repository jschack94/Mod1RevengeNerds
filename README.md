> Goal: Get your competitor (boss) down to HP 0  before they do the same to you.

> You will choose be given the option to choose a move once the match has been begun. You can choose either to attack, defend, or play the wildcard. Once you make your selection, the damage (decrease in computerâ€™s HP) and defense (increase in you HP) will be initiated. The strength of an attack as well as the increase in health will be determined by a random number generator between 2 and 4. You can also choose to play the wildcard which will randomly choose between an attack, defense, and miss. If you randomly land on the attack or defense, you will see a greater amount of damage done on your partner. After you choose your move, your computer will automatically go through the exact same actions until we have a winner.
